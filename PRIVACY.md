# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 14/05/25

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Dark Mode Everywhere** browser extension handles your data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency.

## 1. Data Collection

We **do NOT** collect, store, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, or user usage metrics. 

## 2. Browsing History

We **do NOT** track, log, or read your browsing history. 
The extension requires permission to access "all websites" purely to inject the dark mode styles and scripts necessary for its core functionality. This happens entirely locally on your device.

## 3. Data Storage

All settings (such as "Enabled/Disabled" status, Whitelisted sites, and Warmth settings) are stored **locally** on your device using the browser's storage API (`chrome.storage.local` and `chrome.storage.sync`).
- **Local Storage**: Used for global extension settings.
- **Sync Storage**: Used to sync your whitelisted domains across your own signed-in browser instances. We do not have access to this data.

## 4. Third-Party Sharing

Since we do not collect any data, we do not share, sell, or disclose any user information to third parties.

## 5. Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer.
